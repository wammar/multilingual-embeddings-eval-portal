ARCO seeks partner for Venezuela oil deal . Atlantic Richfield Co ( ARCO ) and Venezuela ' s Corpoven are seeking an additional partner or partners for a $ 3 . 5 billion project to upgrade heavy crude which the two companies signed Wednesday , company officials said . " We do anticipate taking one or two additional partners into the project , " ARCO chairman Mike Bowlin told a news conference in Caracas after signing the deal . The additional partner will likely provide the outlet for the synthetic 25 - degree API crude ARCO expects to upgrade from 9 - degree API crude in Venezuela . ARCO ' s refineries in California and Washington State were poorly placed to take the crude , Bowlin said . " I think it is natural that the market will probably be in the Texas Gulf Coast . . . but we do think it will be a marketable product and we will look for downstream integration with someone else , " he said . Bowlin refused to comment on which companies had been approached to join the joint venture . Corpoven officials have said that Philipps Petroleum Co was a likely candidate . Bowlin insisted that the venture , which will produce 180 , 000 barrels per day of synthetic crude - - similar to Alaska North Slope - - by 2006 , was a first step into penetrating Venezuela ' s oil industry . " We hope this will be the first of many new endeavors we will undertake in this country , " he said . ARCO Coal Company President Stephen Mut added that Venezuela " is one of a few countries where ARCO can participate across the whole spectrum of our activities , " including coal and petrochemicals . - - Omar Lugo , Caracas newsroom , 582 834405
