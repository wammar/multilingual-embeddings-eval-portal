BADMINTON - CHINA BATTLE PAST INDONESIA INTO SUDIRMAN FINAL . China , the defending champions , clinched a place in the Sudirman Cup mixed team badminton final , but only after a tough clash against Indonesia on Friday , the Chinese edging home 3 - 2 . With Susi Susanti scoring a surprise win over world and All - England champion , Ye Zhaoying , the outcome eventually rested on the final women ' s doubles tie . But , this time , there was never any hint of an upset as the Olympic champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun cruised to a 15 - 3 15 - 3 victory over Eliza and Rosiana Zelin . In the final , China will meet the winner of the other semifinal between Denmark and South Korea being played on Friday evening . China gained an early advantage with Liu Yong and Ge taking the mixed doubles in straight games , 18 - 15 15 - 13 , against Limpele Flandy and Minarti Timur . But the ever popular Susanti , one of the most successful ever woman players , set the match alight when she staged a thrilling fightback against Ye . The Chinese player comfortably took the opening game 11 - 6 , but Susanti , the former world champion who has now dropped to number five in the world , sent the tie into a third end by taking the second 11 - 6 . The decider was totally one - sided with Susanti , who recently married the former Olympic Champion , Allan Budi Kusuma , in totally dominant form , while Ye crumbled dramatically under the pressure and failed to win a point in going down 11 - 6 6 - 11 11 - 0 . It was a win that raised Indonesia ' s hopes of reclaiming the title that had eluded them since the inaugural year of 1989 in Jakarta and helped set the stage for a dramatic climax . China regained the advantage in the men ' s singles with All - England Champion Dong Jiong crushing veteran Ardy Wiranata 15 - 2 15 - 8 , but Budiarto Sigit and Chandra Wijaya set - up the final tie decider with a 15 - 8 15 - 6 win over Liu and Sun Jun in the men ' s doubles . " We all played our best , but China are stronger overall and deserved the win , " said Susanti . " I was delighted with my own form and it gives me confidence for next week ' s individual championships . "
