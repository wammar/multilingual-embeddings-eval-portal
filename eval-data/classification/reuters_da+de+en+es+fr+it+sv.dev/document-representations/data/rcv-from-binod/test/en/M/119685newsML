Euro - bourses slip despite on target U . S . data . U . S . prices data released on Wednesday came in right on target but failed to provide the impetus to kick stock markets back on to a record path .

The FTSE 100 index of leading shares was down nearly 27 points by mid - afternoon after stronger - than - expected unemployment and earnings numbers , together with a strong rise in public borrowing weighed on the market . " The ( British ) figures were disappointing for the bulls but shouldn ' t come as a surprise for anyone in the real world . The economy can ' t be the best in Europe and be immune from falling unemployment , " said SocGen strategist Andy Hartwill . " This market is being driven by the perpetual hope that interest rate increases are something you read about in fairy stories rather than happen in the real world . " French stocks pared some of their losses in early afternoon trading after the U . S . data , but the impact was only temporary and by 1415 GMT the CAC - 40 index was off 15 points at 2 , 152 .
