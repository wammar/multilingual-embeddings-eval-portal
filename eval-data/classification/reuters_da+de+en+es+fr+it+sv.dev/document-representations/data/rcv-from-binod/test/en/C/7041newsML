ValuJet faces delay on resuming flights - report . ValuJet Airlines , which stopped flying two months ago because of U . S . regulators ' concerns about its flight safety , will not get approval to resume operations by Friday , its target date , the Washington Post reported on Wednesday . Quoting unidentified sources at the Transportation Department , the newspaper said the airline might have to wait until at least early September to begin flying again . The Atlanta - based carrier voluntarily grounded its fleet on June 17 after the Federal Aviation Administration found " serious deficiencies " in its maintenance program . The FAA inspections followed the May 11 crash of Flight 592 in the Florida Everglades . The discount carrier began two days of federal safety " proving runs " on Tuesday and ValuJet executives had set the end of this week as their target for resuming operations . ValuJet first must obtain clearances from the FAA , which is reviewing the airline ' s aircraft and safety procedures , and the Transportation Department , which is reviewing its financial health and management . The Post said the Transportation Department , which oversees the FAA , appeared to be at least 10 days away from issuing the airline a " certificate of fitness . "
