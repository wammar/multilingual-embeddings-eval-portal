Fed seen holding U . S . interest rates steady . The U . S . Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday to discuss the future course of interest rates and is widely expected to keep rates steady amid mixed signals on the economy . " The speeches made by various Fed governors and by bank presidents recently are not pointing toward tightening , " said Preston Martin , chairman of HomeVest Financial Services Inc . in San Francisco . " I would think the odds are very heavily weighted toward the prospect that there will be no change at the next policy making meeting , " said Martin , a former Fed vice chairman . The Fed ' s policy - making Federal Open Market Committee is due to start meeting at 9 a . m . EDT ( 1300 GMT ) . If past practice is followed , any decision by the FOMC should be announced around 2 : 15 p . m . EDT ( 1815 GMT ) . Martin ' s forecast was shared unanimously by the 30 economists polled last week by Reuters , although some of those experts did not rule out an interest - rate rise later this year . The Fed meeting takes place at a time when questions abound about whether the economy is beginning to cool off after growing at a fast clip in the second quarter . Until just a few weeks ago , many economists believed that the economy was growing quickly enough to require an interest - rate rise by the Fed to slow it down and prevent inflation . However , a series of recent reports containing early signs of a slowdown changed those views . " We had data very recently showing the housing market is starting to fade and the inflation reports were good , " said Joel Prakken , chairman at the St . Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Associates Advisors LLC . " All of that suggests we are seeing a slowdown from the second quarter and that the Fed does not need to move , " he added . Some experts , however , said the economic signs were inconclusive and did not rule out a rate rise later this year . Any rate increase would represent a reversal in the Fed ' s monetary policy . The previous rate change was in January , the last of a series of credit easings undertaken when the economy appeared soft . The economy has rebounded strongly since then . The federal funds rate , which commercial banks charge each other for overnight cash , is now at 5 . 25 percent . The funds rate is controlled by the Fed and acts as a benchmark for other short - term interest rates . The discount rate , which the Fed charges member banks for loans , stands at 5 percent .
