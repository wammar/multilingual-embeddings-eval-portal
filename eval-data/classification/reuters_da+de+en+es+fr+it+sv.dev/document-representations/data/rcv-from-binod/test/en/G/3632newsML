Dole ' s post - convention " bounce " may not be enough . By Alan Elsner , U . S . Political CorrespondentBob Dole ' s presidential campaign received a substantial boost from last weeks ' s Republican convention . But was it enough ? President Bill Clinton still holds a lead of four to 12 percentage points over the Republican presidential nominee with 12 weeks to go until Election Day on Nov . 5 , according to opinion polls released on Monday and Tuesday . The polls were taken at a point when Dole was enjoying maximum benefit from a week in which he and his party were able to project their message to a national audience virtually uncontested by Democrats . That period has already ended , and Clinton , a tireless campaigner and persuasive speaker , is moving to recapture the intitiative ahead of next week ' s Democratic convention . Most worrying for Dole , evidence is growing that whatever bounce he received from the convention is already dissipating . An ABC tracking poll that had Clinton only four points ahead of Dole on Monday showed his lead lengthening to 12 points by Tuesday in a three - way race that also included Texan billionaire Ross Perot . Monday ' s poll had Clinton leading Dole by 44 percent to 40 percent . One day later , Clinton jumped to 49 percent and Dole slumped to 37 percent . Perot fell to 10 percent from 11 percent . The figures were consistent with a New York Times / CBS poll released on Monday , which also showed Clinton leading by 12 points , 49 percent to 37 percent . Perot trailed with seven percent . The phenomenon of the " convention bounce " is well documented in U . S . politics , and bounces seem to be growing larger as the electorate grows more volatile and less attached to the two major parties . " It just about always happens . It ' s real . What ' s important is how big it is and how long it lasts , " Gary Langer , senior polling analyst for ABC television , said . " Dole remains well behind , given the fact that we haven ' t had the Democratic convention and Clinton ' s bump in the polls which will inevitably occur , " said Mark Rozell , a political scientist at the American University in Washington . With Clinton due to sign three popular pieces of legislation this week on health insurance , the minimum wage and welfare reform , the bloom may be off the Dole revival before the Democratic convention opens in Chicago next Monday . University of Cinncinati pollster Al Tuchfarber said the polls to watch would be those conducted in early September . " If Dole is within eight to 12 points of Clinton , this will be a very close and exciting race , " he said . He cited three factors that could help Dole : - - Polls of registered voters , as opposed to likely voters , tend to underestimate Republican support . Most polls being conducted now are of registered voters . - - Undecided voters tend to break for the challenger rather than the incumbent at the last minute . - - If support for Perot stays in single digits , his support may crumble in the final days of the campaign , with most of it going to Dole . " I suspect when the dust settles after the Democratic convention next week , Clinton will emerge with an eight - to 10 - point lead , " said John Geer , an expert on public opinion trends with Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee .
