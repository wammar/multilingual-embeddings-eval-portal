Drought seen as threat to Kenya ' s economic growth . Investor jitters over general elections in the next year and drought sweeping through Kenya have combined to slow the country ' s growth , economic analysts and senior financial officials said on Tuesday . The Central Bank of Kenya posted 1996 gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth at 4 . 8 percent compared with 4 . 9 percent in 1995 . That figure was lower than a 6 . 0 percent figure forecast by the finance ministry . The central bank also forecast growth at 6 . 0 percent in 1997 and 7 . 0 percent in 1998 versus treasury forecasts of 7 . 0 percent and 8 . 0 percent respectively . The central bank posted Kenya ' s three - month overall annualised inflation at 14 . 7 percent in February from 9 . 4 percent in January on rising food prices and said it expected the trend to continue in March . The Coffee Board of Kenya , citing drought and disease , has already forecast a drop in production and earnings this year . Coffee is Kenya ' s third largest foreign exchange earner . Economic analysts said jitters in an election year meant that inward direct investment was not as fast as expected . They added that a three - month delay in the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) disbursement of a second tranche of $ 37 million of an agreed $ 220 million in a soft - loan programme also helped undermine investor and donor confidence in Kenya . Shortages of power , water , and poor roads worsened the investment and growth climate , the economic analysts said . IMF officials said an IMF Kenya review mission in December was not completed because a privatisation timetable for the Kenya Posts & Telecommunications Corp was not presented . They said the outstanding issues were mainly structural and revolved around privatisation because donors did not want the Kenyan government to continue bailing out ailing parastatals . Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem said inadequate infrastructure , insecurity and corruption at many levels of government , together with a weak and corrupt judicial system , uncertainty over long - term control of inflation and political uncertainty remained Kenya ' s current investor concerns . He hinted at a news conference on Tuesday that with drought , which President Daniel arap Moi has already declared a national disaster , the GDP growth estimate for 1997 would not be met . " People have already started talking about GDP growth of just 4 - 5 percent , " Cheserem told reporters . But he said despite the lower - than - expected GDP growth , the economy was relatively healthy and GDP growth was picking up from comparatively depressed figures such as 0 . 2 percent in 1993 and 0 . 5 percent in 1992 . He saw irreversible economic reforms of the last three years , relative political stability in a turbulent region and developed communications as " Kenya ' s positive list " . Cheserem said real interest rates were very high and his bank was determined to reduce them through a combination of monetary and fiscal policies . Interest rates on the 91 - day main category of treasury bills is now around 21 percent . Base lending rates in commercial banks range from 24 percent to 35 percent . - - Nairobi Newsroom + + 254 - 2 330 - 261
