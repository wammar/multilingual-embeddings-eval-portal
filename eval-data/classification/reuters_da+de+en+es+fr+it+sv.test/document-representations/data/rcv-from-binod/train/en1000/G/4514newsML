RTRS - Australian Labor defector to support party . Australian Labor Opposition Senate leader John Faulkner said on Tuesday that Mal Colston , a Labor senator who resigned from the party earlier in the day , had indicated he would support the party in the Senate . " Senator Colston has indicated to Gareth Evans , the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party , that he will support the party on all major issues before the Senate , " Faulkner told reporters . Faulkner said Colston had been pre - selected and endorsed by Labor for decades and the Labor party expected him to show a minimal amount of loyalty on the floor of the Senate . " We will demand of Senator Colston that he show that minimal level of loyalty to the party that has supported him in public life for so long , " Faulkner said . Colston said he intended to complete his present term in the Senate as an independent . " My voting pattern in that chamber will be influenced by my long held Labor beliefs , by an acceptance that the present government has an electoral mandate to pursue a number of issues and by what I judge to be the most appropriate course of action for the people of Queensland ( state ) , " he said in statement . Colston was unavailable for further comment . His resignation means he is no longer bound by party policy and can decide his own position on legislation . The Labor opposition and minor parties hold the balance of power in the Senate and have pledged to block some of the new Liberal - National government ' s reforms , including the partial privatisation of Telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp . - - Canberra Bureau 61 - 6 273 - 2730
