CRICKET - KLUSENER PUTS SOUTH AFRICA ON TOP . A run - a - ball century from Lance Klusener followed by an Indian collapse left South Africa in an unassailable position on the second day of the second test on Friday . Klusener , batting at number nine , launched a ferocious assault on a tiring attack as he and the more sedate centurion Brian McMillan broke a 95 - year - old mark to set an eighth wicket record partnership of 147 in South Africa ' s 529 for seven declared . Facing a tricky 16 overs to the close , India ' s reply began disastrously when Woorkeri Raman was run out for five by Klusener , who then completed a personally unforgettable day by bowling Rahul Dravid in his first over . With Paul Adams following up with the wicket of nightwatchman Venkatesh Prasad for a duck , India were 29 for three at the close - - still needing a further 301 to avoid the follow - on . South Africa had already been put in a strong position by Klusener and McMillan , whose 147 in 140 minutes eclipsed the country ' s previous record of 124 set in 1902 - 03 by A . W . Nourse and E . A . Halliwell against Australia in Johannesburg . McMillan ' s share of the eighth - wicket partnership was a mere 39 as Klusener - - who took eight for 64 on his debut against India in Calcutta in November - - went on the rampage . Playing in his fourth test match , the Natal all - rounder took just 36 balls over his second 50 and his undefeated 102 included 13 fours and two sixes from 100 balls . He twice hit Javagal Srinath for three successive boundaries and displayed a nerveless temperament as he crashed Doda Ganesh for a further three successive fours to go to three figures . McMillan , by contrast , edged to his century . He eventually recorded his third test hundred after facing 227 balls in a five hour , 23 minute stay , hitting nine fours . The total was South Africa ' s highest since readmission and their best against India . It was also only the second time three South Africans had scored centuries in the same test innings following Gary Kirsten ' s 103 of Thursday . A day of records also included a record seventh wicket stand against India of 83 between McMillan and Dave Richardson ( 39 ) . That pair came together after India removed Hansie Cronje ( 41 ) and Shaun Pollock ( 1 ) in the first 10 overs of the day . Wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia took his fourth catch of the innings to remove Cronje to reach the landmark of 50 test dismissals . However India ' s woes increased when the keeper suffered a gash above the eye while fielding and was unable to take his place as opener . Leg spinner Anil Kumble conceded 100 runs in a test innings without taking a wicket while Ganesh ' s 23 . 5 overs cost 93 runs . India face a long haul to get back into the series having lost the first of the three tests by 328 runs .
