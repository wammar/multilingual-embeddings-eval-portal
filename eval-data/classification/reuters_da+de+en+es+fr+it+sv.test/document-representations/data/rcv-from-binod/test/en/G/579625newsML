NATO must stay Europe ' s main defence body - - UK . Britain ' s new Labour government signalled on Tuesday it would oppose any moves to bring defence under the wing of the European Union , saying NATO must remain the bedrock of the West ' s security . Echoing the views of the previous Conservative administration , Foreign Minister Robin Cook and Defence Minister George Robertson told a meeting of the Western European Union ( WEU ) defence must remain an inter - governmental issue . " We do not see the European Union becoming a defence organisation , such a development would undermine NATO , " Cook told reporters . But the two men , attending their first international gathering as ministers , used the occasion to underline they wanted a new constructive approach towards Europe and said they foresaw scope for close cooperation between the EU and WEU . " We are looking for partnership , not a takeover , " Cook added , saying the WEU could be used for certain humanitarian missions . France and Germany had proposed merging the WEU , the EU ' s designated defence arm , into the European Union as part of plans to try and create a common foreign and security policy . Those proposals will be debated at a special EU summit this summer . The WEU consists of 10 EU members - - France , Germany , Britain , Italy , Greece , Spain , Portugal , Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands . A further 18 countries are linked through partnership and association agreements . Britain ' s previous Conservative government strongly opposed moves towards European integration , but favoured close military ties with other countries through the WEU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) . Independent analysts say there is virtually no difference between the positions of the old and new governments in London , but said the more co - operative style of the incoming Labour administration was welcomed by Britain ' s European allies . As if to mark the different approach , Robin Cook began his intervention with a joke , saying in politics as in military matters it was an advantage to have a big majority - - a reference to Labour ' s May 1 election landslide . Austria ' s Defence Minister Werner Fasslabend said Britain clearly wanted to end its isolation in Europe and play a " more constructive role " . " The way they presented their views was very credible , " he told reporters . The routine meeting of the WEU examined ways to try to create a more distinct European role within NATO . Robertson said the WEU had a role as a pivot between the WEU and NATO and was the best way to use scarce resources without duplicating them . " There is no need for Europe to create new institutions , " he said , adding NATO had a track record in the security field . Under a complex deal , the WEU is to be allowed to use certain NATO equipment for limited European - only operations . Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said her country , which is a full NATO member but only an associated member of the WEU as it is not in the European Union , would be allowed to take a full part in any WEU operation . Ankara had previously threatened to block any transfer of NATO material to the WEU if Greece did not agree to its full participation . The meeting began with a discussion on the crisis in Albania with several speakers regretting the WEU had not been used as the organisation for the launching of a multi - national force , led by Italy , to the chaotic Balkan country . " I cannot but regret the fact that Operation Alba was undertaken outside the institutional framework of the WEU . Coalitions of the willing should not become the norm for European military operations , " WEU secretary - general Jose Cutileiro said in his opening address . The ministers agreed to set up a military committee within the WEU , similar to one at NATO , to plan the technical side of any WEU operation .
