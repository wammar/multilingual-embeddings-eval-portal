BSkyB sees digital TV link with BT . Satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting could link up with British Telecom to provide new services when it launches digital television next year . " That is a possibility , " said BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm when asked about the prospect of linking with BT to supply interactive services . BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite television late next year and is reportedly talking to a number of partners about promoting and subsidising the launch . " We need to be able to get decoders to customers at the best price , " said Chisholm . " There is no question that there is a very big demand for it ( digital satellite ) if you can get it right , " he added . He said that BSkyB was ideally placed for a digital launch thanks to the success of its analogue services . BSkyB now has some 5 . 5 million subscribers in Britain and Ireland . Chisholm said he could not comment on negotiations with the BBC on setting up new channels based on BBC programming . " Most of it is widely reported in the press . . . I don ' t want to add anything to it , " he said . BSkyB faces strong competition from cable and satellite channel group Flextech for the deal with the BBC . Flextech , 51 percent owned by Tele - Communications Inc of Denver , is seen as the favourite to clinch an agreement as it could provide the BBC with access to the north American market . - - Keith Weir , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8793
