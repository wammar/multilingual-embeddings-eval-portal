Texas vampire chasing Dracula in fame stakes . In the world of vampires , only Dracula is bigger than Cayne Presley . The Texas blood - sucker who recently disclosed her habit of drinking human and animal blood has become an overnight sensation , unable to drive down the streets in this dusty border city without people honking , waving or staring . Boxes of mail arrive at her door each day while the phone rings constantly from reporters calling from Argentina , Venezuela , Mexico , France , England and Australia , all begging for interviews . " I really wasn ' t expecting this , " said Presley , a 38 - year - old night security guard who first began drinking blood when she was nine . " I guess I ' m a star , or a freak . " Presley ' s sudden stardom came after she gave an interview to an author writing a non - fiction book about vampires in the United States and titled " Something in the Blood . " A follow - up interview with Reuters sparked a flood of interest in her blood - sucking lifestyle . " They all want to know if I sleep in a coffin and if I have fangs , " Presley said on Thursday . She said she drinks one or two glasses of blood a day , sometimes offering human donors sex in return for their blood or else turning to a local butcher who gives her cow blood . Although Presley does not have fangs , some have told her she does look a little like a vampire because she ' s tall , thin and pale with jet - black hair . She also always dresses in black and wears deep red lipstick . For years , Presley said she was ashamed of her hunger for blood and hid the habit from everyone but the closest of her friends . Then one day a former boyfriend blabbed about Presley ' s thirst to all her friends and co - workers . Some were disgusted or scared but others took it in stride . Presley said she was not bothered by the current blaze of publicity . " I want to get the word out . We ' re not blood - thirsty killers . We ' re just blood thirsty . " She said she has received mail from " fans " interested in becoming vampires or offering themselves as donors . " That ' s good because I was down to just one donor , " Presley said , explaining that she pricks a donor on the inside of the arm and then sucks gently so as not to collapse a vein . " It ' s great , better than sex , more intimate . You ' re trusting each other with your lives . And not just for me . People get addicted to me ( drinking their blood ) , " she said . But not all of Presley ' s mail is from fans . She received at least one letter from an Ohio man pledging to come to her home and drive a stake through her heart . She brazenly wrote him back to " come and try . " Presley is one of an estimated 8 , 000 vampires in the United States , according to experts interviewed in " Something in the Blood . "
