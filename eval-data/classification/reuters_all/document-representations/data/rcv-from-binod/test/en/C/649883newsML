Samsung seen at crossroads of automaking venture . A move by South Korea ' s Samsung Motors Inc to begin a debate about restructuring the nation ' s struggling car industry has backfired at a critical juncture for the upstart auto manufacturer , analysts said on Tuesday . Rumoured to be short on cash and hobbled by a need for technology , Samsung has become increasingly desperate to buy its way into the industry , they said . " There must be a sense of urgency on the part of Samsung in light of global excess supply issues and the need for restructuring , " said Kang Hoon - suk , an analyst at ING Barings . " The car unit is emerging as a big headache to the whole Samsung Group , " said Lee Hahn - koo , president of Daewoo Research Institute . " When it planned to enter the market , conditions looked much better . Now the story is quite different . " Analysts said Samsung was casting about for a solution when it proposed in an internal report , which is widely believed to have been intentionally leaked to the press , to restructure the crowded domestic auto industry to avert a possible crisis . An industry shake - out would benefit a company with Samsung ' s deep pockets . But the report set off a firestorm of criticism . Kia Motors Corp , the country ' s second - largest carmaker and most attractive takeover target , threatened to sue Samsung . And on Monday , Samsung bowed to strong criticism from its competitors and said it was not interested in any merger and acquisition deals . Analysts said that while the leaked report probably turned public opinion against a Kia takeover , such a move nonetheless remained Samsung ' s best alternative . " Samsung has no other choice but to buy an existing manufacturer in order to survive and grow as a major player , " said Ji Sung - chul , an analyst at LG Economic Research Institute . " The deal , if realised , would give Samsung all it needed - - capacity , technology and , more importantly , a network of part suppliers , " said Kang of ING Barings . Analysts said Samsung was at a critical juncture and must decide whether to go ahead with its original plan to turn out 500 , 000 cars a year by 2002 or to seek a takeover . " Further investment in car production will worsen the group ' s financial status , given the current slump in the car market and the glut in capacity , " Lee of Daewoo said . Oh Kyu - chang , a fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economics and Trade , said Samsung was probably having trouble getting its foreign partner , Nissan Motor Co , to cooperate on transferring technology . Nissan , which has benefited from the yen ' s fall against the dollar in recent years , is now much healthier financially than when it signed a technology contract with Samsung in 1994 . " If Nissan loses interest in helping Samsung , what other Japanese companies would be willing to help Samsung which would become their rival at some point ? , " Oh of the KIET said . " Nissan at first said Samsung could export . But the Japanese maker will try to limit that benefit and others as long as Samsung copies Nissan ' s models , " said Hur Kang , an analyst at Hyundai Securities . Samsung Motor spokesman Han Jae - yoon said the company had experienced no problems financing its planned projects and cooperating with Nissan . A Nissan spokesman contacted in Tokyo refused to discuss Samsung .
