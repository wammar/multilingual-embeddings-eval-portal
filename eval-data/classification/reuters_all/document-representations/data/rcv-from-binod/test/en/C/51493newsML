Nissan Kyushu plant to operate extra days . Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it will operate its Kyushu plant for an extra three days in September to raise production of its Regulus and Pathfinder models . The production increase was decided because of good domestic demand for the Regulus , a newly launched sport - utility vehicle , and persistent strong demand in the United States for the Pathfinder sport - utility vehicle , called the Terrano in Japan , a Nissan spokeswoman said . Nissan , Japan ' s second - biggest carmaker , received 1 , 072 domestic orders for the Regulus in the first 17 days after its launch on August 27 with a monthly target of 1 , 000 . Nissan exports some 6 , 000 Pathfinders per month to the United States due to strong demand , the spokeswoman said . The Kyushu plant , in Fukuoka prefecture , produces the Pathfinder , Regulus , Pulsar ( called the Almera in Europe ) and Sunny models , and will also probably operate for an extra three days in October , the spokeswoman said . Nissan aimed to raise its share of the domestic sport - utility vehicle market to a 27 percent in the year to March 1997 through sales of the new Regulus , up from 25 percent in the six months to March 1996 .
