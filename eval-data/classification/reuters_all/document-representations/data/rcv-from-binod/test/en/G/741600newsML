Toll in thousands if Israel retook PLO areas . An Israeli army war game found Palestinian and Israeli casualties would be in the thousands if Israel re - took areas under PLO rule , local media said on Sunday . " From the simulation it arose . . . hundreds of Israeli soldiers would be killed and thousands wounded . The Palestinians . . . would suffer thousands killed from amidst the Palestinian police and the civilian population , " Israel ' s Maariv daily said . Israel , in deals signed by its prior dovish government , has handed over most of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank to PLO rule since 1994 . Maariv and the daily Yedioth Ahronoth said the army general staff concluded from the war game conducted one month ago that while re - occupying PLO areas was possible it was not the preferred response to an outbreak of hostilities . Army spokesmen refused to comment on the reports . Tension has been high between the sides since March when Israel launched a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem , a move Palestinians viewed as pre - empting final peace talks . The dailies said right - wing legislator Uzi Landau , who is head of parliament ' s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee , and left - wing legislator Uzi Baram attended the war game . Baram refused to comment on the reports to Reuters . Landau , of Likud , told Israel ' s army radio he would neither confirm nor deny the reports . But he added : " The fact that our re - entry into the Palestinian cities could entail a not small cost is not something that should be surprising . " " It is not in Israel ' s interest to get up one fine day , mobilise and attempt to re - enter the Palestinian cities . But it must be no less clear . . . the Palestinians cannot feel as if we would not allow ourselves the necessary operations in their territory , including entering wide parts of Area A , " he said . " Area A " designates territory under Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) control . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who opposed the peace deals , handed over most of the city of Hebron , fulfilling a commitment made by the administration he ousted in May 1996 elections . His green light for the East Jerusalem settlement building plunged negotiations with the Palestinians into deep crisis . Palestinian anger has erupted periodically into clashes between Israeli troops firing rubber bullets and stone - throwing Palestinian demonstrators . But the scenario the Israeli generals fear is a repeat of fighting like that of September 1996 when Palestinian police firing automatic weapons were drawn into the unrest . Sixty - one Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers were killed . In September , Israel revealed it had activated the first phase of " Operation Field of Thorns " , a plan whose final third stage is the retaking of areas handed to the PLO . Maariv said given the likely toll of re - taking PLO areas - - and the damage such bloodshed would cause Israel internationally and with Arab states in particular - - the army preferred other means if fighting broke out with Palestinian forces . Those measures would include hermetically sealing off the areas , massively reinforcing points of friction and deploying helicopter gunships and snipers .
