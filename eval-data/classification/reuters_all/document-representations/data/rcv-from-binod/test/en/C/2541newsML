SmithKline , Cancer Society in tie - in - NYT . Britain ' s SmithKline Beecham Plc will pay $ 1 million a year to the American Cancer Society and put the society ' s name on SmithKline ' s Nicoderm smoking - cessation patches , The New York Times reported on Tuesday . The move is the latest marketing marriage of a drug maker and a non - profit health care association . With the deal , SmithKline stole a march on rival Johnson & Johnson , which recently introduced its own non - prescription nicotine skin patch , Nicontrol , as well as an over - the - counter version of Nicorette chewing gum to help smokers quit . Some professional health care associations have long provided seals of approval and product commendations , but the pressure for corporate tie - ins has mounted as traditional sources of money have diminished . A spokesman for the American Cancer Society said it was discussing other partnerships with its skin care and nutritional products companies . The cancer society was not endorsing any particular product but permission to use its name would be exclusive in a " product category " like the nicotine skin patches , the spokesman told the newspaper . - - New York newsroom , ( 212 ) 859 - 1610
