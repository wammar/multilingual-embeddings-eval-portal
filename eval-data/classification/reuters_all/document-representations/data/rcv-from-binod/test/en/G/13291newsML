U . S . Democrats gather for Clinton coronation . Democrats gathered in this sparkling lakeside city on Sunday for a presidential convention designed to launch Bill Clinton towards a second term and banish shameful memories of their last , disastrous Chicago meeting . Everything seemed to be going their way on the eve of a four - day Democratic Party love - fest that will re - nominate Clinton on Wednesday : a festive atmosphere , a handsome lakeside city at its strutting , party - time best , some glorious weather and an oh - so - polite police force . There were even slight rises in Clinton ' s poll ratings to top things off . " I ' m on my way to Chicago , and I ' m going by train because I want to see people like you that I ' ve been working for and fighting for . . . and because I want America to know we are on the right track , " Clinton told a cheering crowd at a railway station in Huntington , West Virginia at the start of a four - day " whistle stop " campaign trip to Chicago . Vice President Al Gore , who preceded Clinton into the city to warm up the festivities , let loose an unusually harsh personal attack on their resurgent Republican opponent , Bob Dole , and his political ally , House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich . " With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress on behalf of working men and women , " Gore said at a boistrous rally of labour union members . But he urged the unions not to get cocky , saying , " This is going to be a close race , a hard fought race . We need you . " Clinton too is well aware he has serious work to do to stop Dole becoming America ' s 1996 " Comeback Kid , " a role he himself invented four years ago when he upset then - President George Bush and broke a tight Republican grip on the White House . The prospect of an astonishing Dole rebound no longer seems as far - fetched as it did before the August 12 - 15 Republican convention in San Diego , which gave the 73 - year - old former Senate leader a big boost . Polls still put Clinton from five to 12 points up on Dole with Reform Party challenger Ross Perot far behind . But that is a far cry from the 20 - 30 point lead Clinton enjoyed before Dole and running mate Jack Kemp took the limelight in San Diego . The Republican conclave demonstrated that conventions can still change the dynamics of a presidential race , even though they are now commonly derided as meaningless rituals . The Republicans can at least now dream of putting Dole into the White House next January , and he brought his challenge right into the Democrats ' turf on Sunday with a campaign rally attacking Clinton ' s record in a town near Chicago . Clinton ironically has to start the job of blocking Dole ' s post convention momentum in Chicago - - a city which has long been a historic place of shame for Democrats . At their last Chicago convention in 1968 , raucous anti - Vietnam war demonstrations were met with a brutal police crackdown . Scenes of flailing police billyclubs and wafting teargas were beamed to shocked tv audiences worldwide . Then - Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the nomination inside a bitterly divided convention hall , but he effectively lost all chance of defeating Richard Nixon in an election that began a long Republican domination of the presidency . Chicago hopes to wipe out that stain with a blend of sugar and spice . Its police force has been trained - - with films of the ' 68 debacle to hammer home the point - - to provide firm but restrained security in an era more worried by acts of terror than political protests . The city itself , filled with good restaurants , jazz clubs and nightlife of all sorts , is out to show fun - seeking convention delegates that , in the grammatically garbled words of the old Frank Sinatra tune , their kind of town Chicago is . Clinton aimed to start nailing down the lid on any Dole revival - - all along his train route through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana , and then at the convention itself - - by stressing a theme , the future versus the past . This allows him to underscore his rival ' s advanced age and identity with the World War II generation without seeming mean or disrespectful of a wounded war hero .
