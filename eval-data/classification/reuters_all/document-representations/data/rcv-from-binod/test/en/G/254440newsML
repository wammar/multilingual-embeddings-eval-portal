Refugees start returning to Rwanda from Tanzania . Rwandan refugees began crossing into Rwanda from Tanzania on Friday after Tanzanian troops put up roadblocks to stop tens of thousands moving deeper into Tanzania from their border camps . While some walked into Rwanda , thousands tried to break through a Tanzanian army cordon to get back into Benaco camp but were beaten back by soldiers wielding sticks . Earlier on Friday a flood of nearly half a million Rwandan and Burundian refugees trekked away from their camps near Tanzania ' s border with Rwanda to avoid being repatriated by the end of the month , a deadline announced by the Tanzanian government and the United Nations last weeek . But confronted by roadblocks manned by Tanzanian troops a vast tide of refugees turned back to their camps , only to find they had been sealed off . Hundreds of refugees dropped their bundles of belongings on the roadside and sprinted across vegetable fields to reach Benaco camp but most appeared resigned to going back to Rwanda . Many of the Hutu refugees have said they fear reprisals or punishment for the 1994 genocide of Tutsis if they return to Rwanda but others have said they would be willing to return if they had no choice . Refugees who wanted to sit down were told to keep moving . " A huge mass has just turned round , tens of thousands . They are heading north towards the border and Benaco camp . It is an absolutely incredible sight right to the horizon as far as you can see , " said a spokeswoman for the World Food Programme ( WFP ) . " The people we had been watching for the past 24 hours going southeast are now going north along the same road , " she said . The refugees were loaded down with piles of belongings . One child sat on the handlebars of a bicycle clutching a duck . Reporters estimated more than 100 , 000 refugees headed back towards Rwanda after setting out on what they said would be a marathon trek to asylum in Kenya or as far south as Malawi . Ngara is about 600 km ( 370 miles ) west of the Kenyan border and about 850 km ( 530 miles ) northwest of the Malawi border . " Go back to the camps and you will get fed . We don ' t want you here . We want you to go back , " Tanzanian army Colonel Urbano Nguvumali told refugees on the road . But thousands of refugees slipped away before the roadblocks were set up and it was not clear how the Tanzanian authorities would round them up and send them back to Rwanda . The exodus had threatened a repeat of events in Zaire in November when over half a million Rwandan Hutus fleeing a revolt by Zairean rebels left camps to return to Rwanda while many fled or were driven by Hutu militia deeper into Zaire . Sadako Ogata , the U . N . High Commissioner for Refugees , appealed to Tanzanian authorities on Thursday to redirect the refugees back towards their camps but without using force . Aid workers said it appeared the refugees , many of them elderly , turned back peacefully as the grip of Hutu intimidators over them had been broken once they left the camps . U . N . officials , who had been in despair earlier on Friday at the exodus , were ecstatic as they watched the return flow . " I ' m very pleased to see a returning trend , " said Anne Willem Bijleveld of the U . N . refugee agency ( UNHCR ) in Ngara . UNHCR blamed Hutu intimidators for the exodus . The Hutu Interahamwe militia played a leading role in the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis before being driven into exile in Zaire and Tanzania by Tutsi rebels who formed a new government . The Interahamwe fear reprisals if they return home and want to keep the mass of refugees with them in exile .
