CSCE world sugar futures ended little changed Thursday , in quiet trade , in line with London white sugar which was also little changed . 
CSCE October sugar ended unchanged at 11.73 cents a lb , after trading in a 11.77-11.65 cent range . 
the October / March spread widened slightly to 37 cents . 
October sugar has been in an 11.40-11.90 cent range for nearly two months , after ralling from lows around 9.80 cents earlier this year . 
&quot; Recently the market has been bearish on forecasts of longer term supply , especially from Brazil , &quot; Refco analyst Anne Prendergast said . 
&quot; But some well known houses have been reducing their forecasts of the supply / demand surplus this year to around 1.5 million tonnes from over 5.0 million earlier , &quot; she said . 
&quot; In 13 of the past 15 years sugar prices usually decline in July but this year they did not , suggesting demand may be better than expected . 
&quot; As a result the market has been protecting itself against a breakout with options and October &apos;s option open interest is high at 8,000 lots with only two weeks to expiry , so we could get some volatility , &quot; she said . 
in physical market news , Syria issued a new tender to buy 26,000 tonnes of white sugar and 26,000 tonnes of raws for October / November delivery to replace a cancelled tender . 
in other news , Egypt will be tendering for 25,000 tonnes of white sugar on September 4 and 25,000 of white or raw sugar on September 17 .
