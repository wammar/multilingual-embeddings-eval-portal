Zaire &apos;s government on Monday rejected a ceasefire with rebels who have captured much of the country &apos;s east and instead launched the first reported air raids against rebel-held towns , killing at least nine people and wounding up to 37 in one town . 
&quot; The government stresses that it cannot accept a ceasefire with unidentified belligerents , &quot; Foreign Minister Kamanda Wa Kamanda said in a statement issued just before he met U.N. special envoy Mohammed Sahnoun , who is trying to end the war . 
at the same time , Zaire stepped up its counter-offensive against Tutsi-led rebels who have made large territorial conquests since taking up arms last October . 
the bombing of Bukavu , where the dead were reported , was the first government aerial attack confirmed by independent sources since rebels launched a military campaign last October and seized a large swath of territory in the vast central African nation . 
Zaire said on Monday its warplanes were bombing three key rebel-held towns in its eastern border provinces and that the raids would increase in intensity . 
&quot; Since this morning the FAZ ( Zaire army ) has been bombing Bukavu , Shabunda and Walikale , &quot; said a defence ministry statement in the capital Kinshasa . 
the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres ( MSF-Holland ) said from the nearby rebel-held city of Goma that at least nine people were killed and up to 37 wounded in a raid on Bukavu by three Zairean government jets on Monday . 
Marcel van Soest , head of MSF-Holland in Goma , told Reuters by telephone that his staff had counted the dead and wounded at a local hospital in Bukavu . 
&quot; According to our people on the ground , who are currently working in the hospital treating the wounded , there are nine confirmed dead and 37 wounded , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Of the wounded , between 15 and 20 were mild cases and the rest were serious , &quot; he added . 
the government accuses the rebels of waging a proxy war for Rwanda , Burundi and Uganda -- which deny involvement . 
the statement implied Zaire could consider a truce with the neighbouring states . 
&quot; Any ceasefire with the regular armies of Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi must be linked to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Zaire , &quot; the statement said . 
Zaire used the occasion of the U.N. mission to blame the world body for a threat by rebel leader Laurent Kabila to attack Tingi Tingi refugee camp near the city of Kisangani . 
it said a statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week that Zaire was arming exiled Hutu hardliners among some 200,000 camp dwellers gave rebels the pretext to threaten a raid . 
U.N. officials said they saw Zairean military supplies being unloaded . 
&quot; The Zaire government demands that the Security Council remove from Zairean territory all Rwandan refugees &quot; including ex-Rwandan soldiers and their militia allies , it added . 
the war in eastern Zaire is intertwined with the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda . 
the Hutu army and civilian militias massacred up to 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 before fleeing en masse into Zaire . 
Hutu hardliners in refugee camps in Zaire plotted revenge attacks on the Tutsi-led government that later took power in Rwanda , stoking tensions in the region . 
meanwhile , Zaire &apos;s ethnic-Tutsis took up arms in October after local authorities said they would expel them to their ancenstral homeland in Rwanda . 
the rebels went on to seize vast tracts of borderland , putting Zaire &apos;s rag-tag army to flight and forcing the government to recruit foreign mercenaries for a counter-attack . 
Sahnoun , a veteran Algerian diplomat , is trying to untangle Africa &apos;s most complex running conflict on behalf of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity . 
he met ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko , who is battling cancer at the same time as struggling to keep his 31-year hold on power in the vast Central African nation . 
Sahnoun made no statement as he emerged from the talks with Kamnda , who is also a deputy prime minister . 
he then went to meet Defence Minister General Lukulia Bolongo before further talks with Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo .
