Germany - The second sugar beet test of 16 August shows a fairly satisfactory increase in root weight ( 131 grams vs 105 grams last year and the average ( 1991 / 95 ) of 122 grams ) . 
however , root weight remained with 477 grams , 6 per cent below that of last year and 7.8 per cent below average . 
as a result of the fairly low increase in sugar content , the increase in sugar per beet was only 23.8 grams vs 24.7 grams last year and the average of 23.5 grams . 
the sugar weight per ha on 12 August reached 6.07 tonnes , 2.9 per cent less than last year and 3.80 per cent below average . 
these figures point to a below average crop this season . 
however , what should not be overlooked is the high number of plants per ha which offers a good potential for further improvement and the high weight of beet leaves , which makes the plants more resistant against future dry spells . 
France - The Fench beet test results of 12 August reflect recent unfavourable weather conditions . 
the increase in root weight was only 8.86 tonnes per ha against 9.99 tonnes last year and the average of 10.47 tonnes . 
the increase in sugar content was also below average which led to a highly unsatisfactory increase in sugar weight per ha ( + 1.49 tonnes vs 1.85 tonnes last year and the average of 1.78 tonnes ) . 
sugar yield per ha on 12 August reached 6.21 tonnes , 10 per cent below that of last year and 15 per cent below average . 
these figures confirm that France will have a lower crop than last year &apos;s 4.601 million tonnes in raw value terms . 
Singapore - Sugar imports in April 1996 amounted to 27,977 tonnes , raw value , sharply up on last year &apos;s 14,179 tonnes . 
this brought cumulative imports in the first four months of 1996 ( January / April ) up to 95,692 tonnes against 90,264 tonnes in the like period the previous year . 
total imports in 1995 reached 271,334 tonnes against 285,420 tonnes in 1994 . 
major countries of origin in January / April 1996 were Thailand with 61,000 tonnes raws against 8,000 tonnes and Malaysia with 20,901 tonnes whites compared to 18,688 tonnes . 
sugar exports in January / April 1996 reached 4,618 tonnes , down from 7,082 tonnes in 1995 . 
total exports in 1995 amounted to 22,136 tonnes against 23,391 tonnes in 1994 . 
this brought cumulative imports in the first half of 1996 ( January / June ) up to 122,574 tonnes , hardly changed from last year &apos;s 121,255 tonnes . 
total imports in 1995 reached 237,332 tonnes against 208,640 tonnes in 1994 . 
major countries of origin in the first half of 1996 were South Korea with 56,432 tonnes whites against 59,348 tonnes , Australia with 13,802 tonnes whites compared to 8,945 tonnes and Thailand with 12,000 tonnes raws against 12,500 tonnes . 
sugar exports in June 1996 amounted to 3,124 tonnes which brought cumulative exports in January / June 1996 up to 38,682 tonnes compared to 24,553 tonnes in 1995 . 
total exports in 1995 reached 67,970 tonnes against 42,696 tonnes in 1994 . 
the major country of destination in January / June 1996 continued to be China with 25,605 tonnes whites against 17,150 tonnes . 
Syria has issued an international tender for 26,000 tonnes of raws and 26,000 tonnes of whites for October shipment . 
August 27 is set as the final date for offers .
