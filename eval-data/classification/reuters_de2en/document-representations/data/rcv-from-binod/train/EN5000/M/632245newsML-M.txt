China &apos;s newest three-year treasury note made a poor debut on the Shanghai spot debt market on Monday , with the price falling back to face value as speculative money continued to flow into shares , analysts said . 
the poor performance reflects continued weak demand on China &apos;s spot state debt market , which has been on a downward trend over the past few months as liquidity keeps flowing into the stock markets , traders said . 
the T-note , maturing in May 2000 , opened at a price of 98.00 yuan ( $ 11.82 ) against a face value of 100 yuan , hitting an intraday low of 97.49 and a high of 98.20 before closing at 97.65 yuan . 
traders said the note sold slowly during its issue in May mainly due to a low coupon of 9.18 percent compared with an average yield of more than 10 percent for existing spot state debt contracts on the Shanghai bourse . 
a total of 40 billion yuan worth of the three-year tradable treasury note was issued in May . 
by the end of its issue period on May 31 , underwriters in Shanghai had sold less than 60 percent of the new bonds , industry sources said . 
&quot; The weak debut was expected due to the slow sales during the issue , &quot; said one state debt trader . 
&quot; The low coupon of the new note , compared with high yields of the former contracts , could only be offset by a price below 98 yuan . 
a second trader said the weak demand indicated a lack of liquidity on the spot state debt market . 
&quot; The booming stock markets and many new ( domestic ) A share issues will continue to suck money out of the spot market , depressing prices of the state debt contracts , &quot; he said . 
so far this year , A shares with a total face value of around five billion yuan have been issued by nearly 100 firms in China on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges . 
the domestic currency A share index on the Shanghai stock exchange has risen around 40 percent so far this year and on the Shenzhen bourse 30 percent , drawing liquidity from the state debt market . 
after the low-key debut on Monday , the yield of the new note had been raised to more than 10 percent and potential for further price falls are seen limited , traders said . 
the note was likely to move around the current level in the short term . 
but the lacklustre debut has hit market sentiment on both the state debt primary or issue market and the secondary or public trading spot state debt market , analysts said . 
&quot; The poor sales and weak debut of the new three-year note will have a great negative impact on the state debt markets , &quot; said one investment analyst . 
&quot; The enthusiasm of underwriters and the public has been hurt , so this will be a difficult year , &quot; he said . 
China plans to issue a record 248.596 billion yuan in state debt in 1997 mainly to cover state deficits and redeem maturing state debt . 
so far , 20 billion yuan in tradable two-year T-notes and 40 billion yuan in tradable three-year notes have been issued . 
another 123 billion yuan in two- , three- and five-year non-tradable notes are being issued from March 1 to October 20 . 
analysts said they expected Beijing to take measures to support the declining state debt markets , possibly by lowering bank interest rates or cutting bank reserve ratios .
