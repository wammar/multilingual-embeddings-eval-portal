silver prices have turned a corner after breaching technical resistance levels and are now poised for further gains , Australian metals dealers said on Tuesday . 
COMEX silver ended up 13.300 U.S. cents an ounce at $ 5.210 , after trading up to a session high at $ 5.240 . 
technical resistance markers surrounding a price of $ 5.15 an ounce had been keeping a cap on the price . 
&quot; We think silver could trade up to around $ 5.40 ( an ounce ) over the next couple of months , &quot; Ross Ryan , a dealer for Macquarie Bank said . 
end users of silver , such as photographic film manufacturers and jewellery fabricators are said to be willing buyers of silver under $ 5.00 an ounce , but may now re-think their buying strategies in light of the price run-up . 
&quot; It all depends on whether silver keeps going up and the price is sustainable , &quot; another dealer said . 
silver has been stuck in a $ 5.00- $ 5.18 range for a couple of months and was long-due for a price move outside the range , the dealer said . 
Australia &apos;s MIM Holdings Ltd , which produced 12.6 million ounces of silver in 1995 / 96 , making it one of the world &apos;s largest silver miners , would see about A $ 5 million added to its bottom line for each 10 percent gain in the price on an annual basis , a company spokesman told Reuters .
