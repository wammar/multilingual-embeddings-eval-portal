Thursday in Bangalore was dress rehearsal day for 88 would-be Miss Worlds and thousands of policemen assigned to safeguard the beauty pageant against violent protests . 
&quot; The countdown begins today , &quot; one police inspector told Reuters at the southern Indian city &apos;s Chinnaswammy cricket stadium where Miss World will be crowned on Saturday night . 
the question most people are asking is where Kinay Narayan Shashikala , the woman threatening to lead a suicide squad to commit self immolation among the audience , will be when the three-hour show is on . 
Amitabh Bachchan , the Hindi superstar whose company holds the rights to stage this year &apos;s event , made an appeal for reason at a packed news conference at the stadium . 
&quot; I &apos;m ready to hold talks with them even now , &quot; the man known as Big B , and friend of assassinated leader Rajiv Gandhi , said . 
Julia Morley , international president of Miss World Ltd , has already tried and failed to talk to Shashikala and others . 
&quot; It is very upsetting I appeal to them to protest peacefully , &quot; Bachchan said , referring to Shashikala and her followers in the Mahila Jagran Samiti ( Forum to awaken Women ) . 
police chiefs and Karnataka state Home Minister Roshan Baig are confident the 10,000-plus mix of police and paramilitary officers will be able to stop any trouble spoiling the show . 
an estimated two billion television viewers are expected to watch Miss World , which has been touted as a showcase for India . 
Shashikala has been under police surveillance , and junior police officers told Reuters they expected that she and her followers would be picked-up before the show begins as a safeguard . 
elsewhere in the arena , where 20,000 people are expected watch Saturday &apos;s final , bomb squads and sniffer dogs scoured the site for unwanted packages . 
while the Miss World troupe was busy turning heads , in the streets outside some young activists practised stopping traffic in preparation for a bigger demonstration on Saturday . 
the activist youth wing of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) tried to block roads in at least three parts of the city and march on the stadium before being dispersed . 
Yediyurappa has already called for a strike on Saturday aimed at bringing the city to a standstill . 
the plan is to block routes into the stadium . 
Yediyuruppa appealed on Wednesday to Shashikala to withdraw her threat of multiple suicides , but the second-year law student and self-defence instructor replied that she would go ahead unless the BJP rally succeeded in halting the show . 
another BJP state deputy Pramila Nesargi plans to hold a Miss Poverty show outside the venue , offering food and clothing to thousands of poor . 
some 20,000 people are expected to pay between 1,900 rupees and 25,000 rupees ( $ 53 to $ 700 ) to watch an extravaganza involving more than 500 performers , plus elephants , and the 88 women . 
price aside , drawbacks include a ban on alcohol , a de facto ban on smoking if cigarette lighters are confiscated , and instructions for ticketholders to pass through the gates at least two hours before the show starts .
