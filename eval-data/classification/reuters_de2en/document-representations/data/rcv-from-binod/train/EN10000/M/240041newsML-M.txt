a sharp drop in stock markets Friday rattled commodity markets with cattle , corn , soybeans and lumber futures ending lower , and gold and silver markets gyrating sharply before ending lower . 
the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 140 points early Friday , which fuelled selling in several commodity markets on the belief the economy was turning sluggish and consumer spending for homes and high-priced foods would slow . 
the Dow later recovered to close down 55.16 points at 6,381.94 , but several commodity markets retained the scars from the earlier stock market drop . 
concerns about an economic slowdown weighed on live cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on the feeling that consumers will buy fewer high-priced steaks and roasts . 
however , Chuck Levitt , analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. , said those perceptions are not always true . 
he said during poor economic times consumers may travel less but will be more inclined to dine at home on high-priced steaks and wine . 
CME December live cattle futures closed down 1 cent at 65.425 cents per pound , the lowest close in 4-1 / 2 months . 
the selling spilled into Chicago Board of Trade corn and soybean markets because less demand for beef could curb usage of these two livestock feed ingredients . 
CBOT December corn closed down 1-1 / 4 cents at $ 2.67-1 / 4 per bushel and January soybeans were off 6 cents at $ 6.96 per bushel . 
soybeans are crushed into soymeal , which is then fed to cattle and hogs . 
CME lumber futures were hit by stock market-based selling largely on assumptions that home buying will slow during a slow economic cycle , traders said . 
some analysts argued that lumber futures were due for a downturn after surging sharply higher in recent months . 
analysts said recent government reports suggested home buying was slowing down . 
the Commerce Department this week reported October new home sales were down 8.7 percent from September , the largest month-to-month drop since March . 
&quot; They ( housing reports ) are all pointing to a very significant slowdown , &quot; said Neil Schmaedick , forest products analyst with Smith Barney . 
new York gold and silver markets bounded higher early Friday as the stocks fell , but later turned lower after a slowdown in jobs growth eased inflation concerns . 
&quot; If it hadn &apos;t been for the weak U.S. employment data , which tempered the falls in U.S. bonds and stocks , gold may have done better and continued its recovery from last month &apos;s slide , &quot; said John Brimelow , New York director of international equities for German bank BV Capital . 
new York commodity Exchange February gold ended down $ 2.20 at $ 370.80 an ounce . 
new York Mercantile Exchange crude oil prices managed to end with small gains after U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali could not confirm reports that Iraqi oil exports would start next week . 
&quot; There is a euphoria in the market that you just can &apos;t break , &quot; said Steve Platt , an analyst with Dean Witter , noting bullish sentiment had the market focusing more on Boutros-Ghali &apos;s comments . 
crude for January delivery settled up 4 cents at $ 25.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
January heating oil ended off 0.45 cent at 74.66 cents a gallon , and January gasoline ended up 0.12 cent at 69.80 cents per gallon .
