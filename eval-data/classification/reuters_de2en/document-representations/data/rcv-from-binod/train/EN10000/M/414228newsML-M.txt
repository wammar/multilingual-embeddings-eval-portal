London &apos;s FTSE 100 share index fought off an early attack of Wall Street-inspired weakness to end little changed on Monday as investors tried to ignore fears of further losses across the Atlantic , dealers said . 
expectations of continued inflows of cash from private investors helped support the London market and cushion the impact of a faltering Wall Street . 
but with more testimony from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and key U.S. data looming , markets would remain on edge , dealers said . 
the FTSE ended 1.2 points down at 4,307.1 , its highest point of the day , after dropping as low as 4,287.3 in early trade . 
&quot; We &apos;ve done remarkably well considering the state of Wall Street , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The Dow has come off more than 150 points in the last few days and we have been coping well . 
dealers said more money was expected this month from private investors , ahead of the April deadline for investing in Personal Equity Plans ( PEPs ) , a tax-efficient method of share ownership . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got another month in which all this PEP money will be coming in , so market-makers are trying not to get caught too short , &quot; one said . 
&quot; That &apos;s helping us hold fairly steady . 
analysts said markets were awaiting the second half of Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey Hawkins testimony on Wednesday . 
last week Greenspan sent stock markets sharply lower with a warning that Wall Street &apos;s recent rise has &quot; rasied questions of sustainability . 
&quot; The February U.S. employment report on Friday will also be a key focus for markets , analysts said . 
&quot; All the noise this week is about the results from companies here and some individual stocks will no doubt be affected , but we have the non-farms at the end of the week and that is what everybody is going to be looking at , &quot; said Philip Isherwood , UK strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson . 
Ex-dividends took 3.45 points off the FTSE on Monday morning and without their impact the index would have ended higher . 
advancing shares outnumbered declining shares by 52-45 but a few blue-chips took a tumble and weighed the index down . 
chief among them was National Westminster Bank plc which dropped 28p to 730-1 / 2 after the announcement of a 50 million stg loss on options trading . 
the shares also went ex-dividend , compounding their weakness . 
most other major banking stocks were weaker too , with only Standard Chartered plc and Royal Bank of Scotland going strongly against the trend . 
standard Chartered ended 25p firmer at 866-1 / 2 as positive sentiment after its results last week continued . 
HSBC Holdings plc , which reported a 23-percent rise in 1996 profits , finished down 30-1 / 2p at 15.515 stg . 
chief executive John Bond predicted a challenging year ahead with increasing competition . 
business services group Hays plc also suffered after releasing results , ending 15p lower at 536 . 
vague bid talk continued to boost insurance shares , with Commercial Union plc climbing 35-1 / 2p to 718-1 / 2 . 
volume on SEAQ was an impressive 1.4 billion by 1635 GMT but dealers said this had been distorted by Yorkshire Water plc and Southern Electric plc &apos;s share buy-backs 
the two companies contributed more than half the total volume on SEAQ and trade had in fact been relatively quiet , dealers said .
