European stocks made healthy gains in early trading on Tuesday , buoyed up by an overnight rally on Wall Street and a stronger dollar which boosted export prospects . 
the dollar , still in a bullish mood after encouraging comments from the recent G7 industrialised countries meeting , moved ahead against the mark and yen , though some dealers were wary ahead of U.S. economic data due later on Tuesday . 
in London , shares on the blue-chip FTSE index pushed through the 4,400-point resistance level to their highest in six weeks , taking their lead from New York which on Monday ended a three-session losing streak . 
wall Street investors overcame a sell-off in Boeing shares after disappointng earnings to push the Dow Jones industrial average up 44.15 to a 6,783.02 close , and give European stocks a lift at the start . 
London dealers , facing a general election this week , said the market should take heart from polls showing the opposition Labour party maintaining its lead , making a &quot; hung &quot; parliament -- and political uncertainty -- less likely . 
&quot; At last everyone has realised that the idea that we were swinging towards a hung parliament was nonsense , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; And with Wall Street pushing higher that is enough to move us up a bit . 
but worries about higher interest rates to check inflationary pressures were renewed by a UK report which showed consumer confidence at its highest since the late 1980 &apos;s , even before the release of billions of pounds from a current wave of building society demutualisations . 
&quot; There are fears growing that we could be about to have a bit of a spending boom , &quot; another dealer said . 
banks once again led the advance , with shares squeezed higher as investment funds flooded into the sector to increase weighting in anticipation of the entry into the FTSE 100 of Halifax and other former building societies . 
the best performer in early transactions was Frankfurt where stocks climbed 0.75 percent after a negative showing on Monday . 
the market was supported by the dollar and the overnight Wall Street advance . 
&quot; Despite the relatively friendly influence from Wall Street , the German market is rather sluggish , &quot; SuedwestLB said in its morning market commentary as the DAX index climbed 20.55 points to 3383.61 . 
but some said the DAX could break the psychologically important 3,400 level during the week and keep up the advance led by dollar-sensitive shares , particularly carmakers , if volumes were to return to the market . 
in Paris , stocks climbed by 0.55 percent , supported by gains in the bonds and the stronger dollar , which would help exporting sectors . 
but business remained quiet as investors , particularly foreign funds , stayed on the sidelines , awaiting results of the British and the French parliamentary elections . 
on currency markets , the dollar was stronger against the mark and yen in Europe morning trade , although fluctuations were small as the market sought fresh incentive after the supportive comments from the G7 finance ministers at the weekend . 
dollar sentiment was positive but overnight Asian trade had been quiet because of a holiday in Tokyo and market operators were looking to U.S. economic data due later in the day for direction . 
while the dollar was clearly attractive in terms of fundamentals , some dealers were uneasy about driving it up rapidly since the G7 meeting had warned against excessive volatility in currencies , analysts said . 
&quot; The bias for the dollar is still clearly higher , but the G7 has played its role here , &quot; said Klaus Baader , senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London . 
&quot; The overall environment is really unchanged in that the markets are beginning to get the feeling that policy-makers don &apos;t want the dollar to go much higher , and yet at the same time there are underlying attractions to the dollar , &quot; he said . 
after trading in a very tight range against both the mark and yen overnight , the dollar was at 1.7324 marks and 126.80 yen , up from 1.7274 and 126.61 in late European trade on Monday . 
trading was expected to be subdued until the afternoon release of a series of U.S. economic data , which was due to continue throughout the week . 
the focus for Tuesday was to be the employment cost index ( 1230 GMT ) for the first quarter of 1997 , since wage pressures were seen as a key ingredient in the Federal Reserve &apos;s decision on interest rates , analysts said . 
the Paris CAC-40 index was up 14.04 points at 2,564.29 . 
the dollar stood at 1.7324 against the mark versus 1.7274 in late European trade on Friday . 
against the yen , the dollar was quoted at 126.80 from 126.61 . 
gold was at $ 341.75 an ounce in early trade after ending at $ 342.45 in London on Friday . 
silver unchanged at was at $ 4.73 .
