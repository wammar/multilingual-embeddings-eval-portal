Japan &apos;s long-term prime rate is likely to be left unchanged at 2.7 percent in December , bond traders said on Friday . 
but it could still be lowered if the Japanese bond market shows a recovery on Monday morning , they added . 
a spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd ( IBJ ) said the bank would announce its decision on its long-term prime rate on Monday afternoon . 
the prime rate , at which long-term credit banks lend to their most creditworthy customers , was cut by 0.3 percentage point to 2.7 percent in October . 
the IBJ customarily sets its long-term prime rate 0.9 percentage point above its debenture coupon rate . 
the yield of the IBJ debentures issued in November with a 1.8 percent coupon stood at around 1.625 percent late on Friday , traders said . 
if the debenture yield remains at around 1.625 percent by Monday noon , the long-term prime is more likely to be left unchanged , sources at long-term credit banks said . 
the historical low for the long-term prime rate is 2.6 percent recorded in December 1995 .
