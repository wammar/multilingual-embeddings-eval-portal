Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan predicted on Monday that a compromise would be reached over issues dividing the United States and developing countries at the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) meeting here . 
Amnuay told a news conference that disagreements on labour standards , the shape of an investment accord and slow implementation of previous agreements to liberalise the agriculture and textile industries should be ironed out . 
&quot; We expect that in the next 48 hours , we will reach an agreement . 
Amnuay said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) is adamant against including labour standards in the WTO and will also oppose the granting of national treatment for foreign companies in a multilateral investment agreement . 
&quot; It &apos;s another matter to link these social issues to trading processes . 
I don &apos;t think the world is ready for that , &quot; he said . 
ASEAN is unanimous &quot; that we will not accept national treatment in a multilateral investment agreement , &quot; he added . 
Thailand also wants some flexibility on a telecommunications agreement , especially in the time frame of its implementation and the kind of products it may cover . 
ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam .
