a boat flying the Panama flag has beaten a West African blockade to reach Sierra Leone , but it was carrying only fuel for generators , not petrol , oil industry sources said on Sunday . 
Sierra Leone &apos;s neighbours have blockaded the country in an attempt to force the military junta that seized power in May to hand power back to elected civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah . 
military officials last week assured Sierra Leoneans that a shipment of petrol was on its way , but people waiting on the dockside were disappointed when the ship , belonging to the rosy Peak shipping company in Hong Kong , docked on Saturday . 
&quot; The ship has brought only marine fuel oil , or what is known as black oil for electricity powerhouses and generators , not the much-needed petrol , &quot; an oil industry source said . 
&quot; There is not even a tea-cup of petrol left in the tanks of Mobil or NP ( National Petroleum Company ) , &quot; the source added . 
there are few taxis on the road in Freetown and most people are having to walk everywhere . 
petrol on the black market is said to be three times the pre-coup cost . 
power cuts have become the norm , but oil industry source said the weekend shipment of black oil would not do much to improve that situation . 
&quot; There was already some black oil in the city . 
the main problem with the powerhouses , which is responsible for the blackouts , its that they have run short of lubricants for the engines and cooling oil to cool the engines , &quot; one source said . 
leaders of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) said they would tighten the blockade after the junta defiantly said last month it would stay in power until 2001 , scuppering peace talks . 
the first vessel to beat the sea blockade , a Russian-registered ship carrying 6,800 tonnes of rice , docked in Freetown on July 31 to scenes of jubilation on the quayside . 
ECOWAS troops under Nigerian command are in control of the main airport and have sealed land borders .
