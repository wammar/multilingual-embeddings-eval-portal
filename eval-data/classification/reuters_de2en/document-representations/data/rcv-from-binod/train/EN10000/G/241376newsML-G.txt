the A-bomb Dome in Hiroshima , a building symbolising the world &apos;s first atomic bombing , has been named a world heritage site despite opposition from the United States , the Japanese Foreign Ministry said on Friday . 
the ministry said that the World Heritage Committee approved the decision on Thursday at a meeting in Merida , Mexico . 
it will be the second site related to World War Two to be named a World Heritage site after the concentration camp complex at Auschwitz in Poland , the scene of Nazi gas-massacres of interned Jews . 
formerly known as the Hiroshima Industrial Promotion Hall , the Czech-designed building was near the epicentre of the bomb dropped by the United States on August 6 , 1945 , which killed more than 140,000 people . 
the Dome and the main structure , located just across a river from the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park , survived the blast and since then have come to symbolise the bombing . 
in Washington on Wednesday , U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said : &quot; The United States will not support the inclusion of Hiroshima as a site on this list -- essentially because we have made the decision that we don &apos;t believe that war-related sites are within the scope of the convention . 
Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Hiraoka welcomed the decision , saying the building was historically important . 
&quot; The A-bomb Dome is a witness to mankind &apos;s first atomic bombing , &quot; Hiraoka said on Friday . 
&quot; It is important that it has been accepted internationally . 
the atomic bombing of Hiroshima still sparks controversy in U.S.-Japan ties . 
last year , U.S. war veterans objected to a planned exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington to mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War Two . 
the exhibit was eventually scaled down to show only the fuselage of the Enola Gay , the U.S. B-29 bomber that actually dropped the bomb , and other displays regarding the military operation , but it included no details about the victims of the attack . 
a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima . 
Japan surrendered on August 15 , 1945 .
