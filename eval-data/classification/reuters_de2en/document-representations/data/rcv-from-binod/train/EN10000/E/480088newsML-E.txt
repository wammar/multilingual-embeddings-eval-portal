with German inflation firmly under control , the Bundesbank faces no pressure to match last week &apos;s U.S. interest rate rise but there is also little chance of a rate cut this week , analysts said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Everything will stay the same , &quot; predicted HSBC Markets economist Ros Lifton about the outcome of the Bundesbank &apos;s policy-setting council meeting on Thursday . 
ten economists polled by Reuters unanimously predicted Germany &apos;s discount rate would remain at 2.50 percent , already an historic low , while the Lombard rate , a ceiling for interest rates , would be kept steady at 4.50 percent . 
the main German money market rate , the repo , is likely to stay at three percent , the prevalent rate since August , they said . 
while the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s increase in short-term federal funds rates to 5.5 percent last week was a preemptive strike to contain inflationary pressures , analysts said the German central bank still had time to hold its fire . 
&quot; America and Great Britain are much further along in their economic cycles . 
we are still in the basement , &quot; said Dresdner Kleinwort Benson economist Stefan Bergheim , arguing that Germany did not face inflation fears which would demand a rate rise now . 
in March the West German inflation rate was 1.6 percent , according to preliminary figures , still comfortably below the Bundesbank &apos;s medium-term two percent goal . 
all along economists had said that an end to a 20-month period of U.S. monetary easing would not automatically pull German rates up . 
&quot; In the U.S. there are currently different circumstances than in Germany . 
we are miles away from needing to take action to hem in potential inflationary pressures . 
currently everything is pretty much in balance , &quot; Armin Kayser , economist at SBC Warburg , said . 
economists agreed , however , that one variable in the scenario could have been currency movements . 
if the dollar gained new ground in the wake of a U.S. rate hike , Germany would soon feel the effects of imported inflation , making the Bundesbank very nervous , they argued . 
but with the dollar now trading around 1.66 marks , below the 1.68 mark level seen before last week &apos;s U.S. rate rise , the currency issue is not forcing the Bundesbank &apos;s hand to either lower or raise rates , economists said . 
in fact , with German growth reviving , economists said the bank would shy away from cutting interest rates again to avoid sending the dollar higher still and putting itself in an awkward position of having to raise rates to brake inflation sooner rather than later . 
currently several economists predict that the Bundesbank might end its five-year easing cycle as soon as the end of the year . 
&quot; The economy is showing stronger growth since the beginning of the year . 
the central bank does not really need to seize the initiative at the moment , &quot; said Gerhard Grebe , chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt . 
but it would be very careful to prevent the German / U.S. 
interest rate differential from widening further -- with a German rate cut for example -- as this would prompt a further dollar appreciation , Grebe added . 
economists also said M3 money supply , the Bundesbank &apos;s key policy indicator , was still too strong , presenting another argument for keeping rates steady for now .
