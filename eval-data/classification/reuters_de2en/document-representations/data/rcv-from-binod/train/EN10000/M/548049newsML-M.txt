European oil swaps were mixed on Tuesday . 
crude and gas oil swaps firmed on tighter supply and good demand , fuel swaps eased on weaker spot markets while gasoline and naphtha swaps held steady , traders said . 
Brent contracts for difference ( CFDs ) saw prompt differentials slipping while distant weeks steadied slightly with physical avails slightly tighter .

further out May 12-16 was four cents firmer at around June Brent -30 / -26 cents while the week after was some six cents stronger at June Brent -27 / -25 cents . 
longer term crude swaps were steady though showing only a narrow contango spanning 30 cents to the end of the year . 
gas oil swaps continued to firm up as volatility to the upside with May gas oil futures breaking $ 167 resistance in early trade fuelling good buying for swaps . 
&quot; The good physical buying and lack of sellers is causing people to load up with swaps as a hedge against the volatility , &quot; a broker said . 
EN590 May contracts were bid at $ 13.50 , up from $ 12 last Friday while May 0.2 sulphur swaps were bid at $ 5 , $ 1 firmer and June talked $ 3.50 / $ 4 as premiums to the IPE .

further out Q3 contracts differentials traded at $ 8 a couple of time and $ 8.25 . 
heavy fuel swaps came under renewed pressure from low sulphur which was offered 50 cents a tonne below late Monday levels . 
&quot; barges are about a dollar lower but low sulphur is causing the damage , &quot; said a Rotterdam trader . 
may barges swaps talked around $ 81 by lunchtime compared to trade in the range $ 81.50 to $ 82.25 on Monday . 
June was 50 cents higher and July $ 1 above May . 
the third quarter was heading toward $ 85 having traded at $ 85.50 and $ 85.75 on Monday . 
low sulphur asked $ 84.50 for May amid strong selling pressure from the physical market at $ 95 CIF Italy . 
June asked $ 1.50 higher on paper but little trade was heard . 
gasoline swap quotes were notional as good physical supplies kept buying interest thin . 
however , traders expected the market to pick up a little soon . 
this sentiment was reflected in a $ 2-3 backwardation for May contracts over June . 
&quot; We &apos;re pretty bullish for May and June ... We &apos;ve seen very little since the buying spree in April , &quot; one trader said . 
may swaps were valued steady around $ 195.50 with June at $ 193 a tonne fob Ara .
