county cricket clubs on Tuesday rejected a move to give England selectors greater control over their international players . 
a clause in the recent Acfield Report recommended that the selection committee chairman should be able to withdraw England players from county matches in order to rest top talent . 
but on Tuesday that was the only one of the 14 Acfield clauses to be thrown out at a Test and County Cricket Board meeting at Lords , although the board hierarchy was assured requests to rest a player would receive &quot; a sympathetic ear . 
the seven-man Acfield committee put forward in-depth proposals earlier this year for streamlining the selection of English teams . 
TCCB chief executive Tim Lamb said : &quot; The Acfield working party will be disappointed , but deep down in their heart of hearts they probably knew it would not get agreement . 
Tuesday &apos;s meeting also rejected a move to have overseas players banned from English cricket in 1999 and 2000 on a trial basis and decided that in future all test matches will include Sunday play , with no rest day .
