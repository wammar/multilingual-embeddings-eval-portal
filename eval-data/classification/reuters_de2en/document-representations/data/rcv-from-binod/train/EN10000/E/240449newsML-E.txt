Canadian capacity utilization in total non-farm goods-producing industries rose 1.3 percentage points to 83.8 percent in the third quarter from a revised 82.5 percent in the second , Statistics Canada said on Friday . 
a survey of Reuter economists had forecast the rate to rise to 84.0 percent in the quarter . 
statistics Canada said the rise in capacity utilization in the quarter came mostly from gains in the manufacturing sector . 
manufacturers increased their use of capacity to 84.3 percent in the third quarter and according to latest Business Conditions Survey by StatsCan , they intended to continue stepping up production in the next three months . 
that , however , would not lead to a rise in inflation , the agency said .
