the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in its six monthly Monetary Policy Statement on Friday projected lower fiscal surpluses than the government forecast in its Thursday budget . 
the bank projected a budget surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 1997 / 98 compared with the budget forecast of 1.5 percent . 
the gap between the two forecasts , which are done on the same methodology , widens . 
the bank projects the ratio at 0.8 percent in the March 1999 year and 0.7 percent in 2000 against Treasury &apos;s forecast of 1.9 percent and 2.6 percent . 
explanation for the bank &apos;s lower forecast lies largely in lower growth forecasts than Treasury &apos;s . 
the RBNZ forecasts real annual average growth at 2.0 in the March 1998 year , rising to 3.6 percent and 3.8 percent in succeeding years . 
Treasury forecasts growth at 2.4 percent in 1998 and then 4.2 percent and 3.5 percent in the following years .
