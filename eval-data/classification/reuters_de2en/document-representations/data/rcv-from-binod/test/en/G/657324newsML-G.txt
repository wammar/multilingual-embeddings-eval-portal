bathing a heart artery with radiation after it has been reopened with an inflated balloon increases the chance that the artery will not close again , a study in Thursday &apos;s New England Journal of Medicine reported . 
long-term effects of the radiation are unknown but doctors call it a promising technique against heart disease . 
the goal is to improve the success rate of angioplasty , an operation in which a balloon-tipped tube is threaded into the arteries feeding the heart muscle and inflated at a point where an artery has been narrowed by heart disease . 
the procedure squashes the debris against the walls of the artery and allows blood to flow freely again , but in 30 to 60 percent of the cases the artery closes or becomes blocked again , a process known as restenosis . 
a mesh-like cylinder known as a stent is then inserted into the artery to support it , which cuts the likelihood the vessel will reclose by about 30 percent . 
but in some cases the walls of the artery react to the angioplasty by producing new tissue , which starts plugging up the artery all over again . 
the radiation technique is designed to discourage the artery from producing that tissue . 
in tests of 26 volunteers , doctors put a stent in place and kept a tiny radioactive ribbon in the once-narrowed artery for 20 to 45 minutes . 
another 29 people , who served as the placebo group , had a tiny non-radioactive ribbon inserted . 
six months later , the blood vessels had closed again in 17 percent of the patients who had the radiation treatment versus 54 percent from the placebo group . 
the benefits were sustained a year after the treatment . 
&quot; The patients treated with iridium-192 had a striking reduction &quot; in the risk of having arteries narrow again , said the research team led by Dr. Paul Teirstein of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla , California . 
the long-term effects of the treatment remain a mystery . 
people who have received high doses of radiation to treat cancer have a slightly higher risk of heart disease . 
although researchers still need to refine the treatment , &quot; at the present time , a radiation device looks very promising as a potential solution to the problem of restenosis , &quot; Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , said in an editorial in the Journal . 
in another study in the same issue , doctors from 69 medical centers in the United States and Canada reported that the drug abciximab prevented complications while doctors probed for signs of heart disease . 
in past tests of the drug , made by Centocor Inc of Malvern , Pennsylvania , the medicine seemed to increase the risk of unwanted bleeding even though it helped keep the heart muscle healthy while doctors probed the arteries feeding it . 
but the latest research suggests excess bleeding was caused by the anti-clotting drug heparin that was given in addition to the abciximab . 
when the amount of heparin was reduced , that unwanted side effect disappeared .
