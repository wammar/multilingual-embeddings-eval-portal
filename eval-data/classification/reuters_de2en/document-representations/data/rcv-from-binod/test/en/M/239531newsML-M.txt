South African bonds were left relatively unscathed on Friday by the selloff on world financial markets triggered by comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan . 
the key R150 ended the day at a 15.97 percent yield after settling at 15.86 percent on Thursday . 
the R150 touched an intraday high of 16.02 percent in the afternoon session following a selloff of U.S. treasuries which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to a four-week high of 6.61 percent . 
Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday that the Fed had to be wary when &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; infected stocks and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy . 
analysts said his comments had revived fears about the outlook for interest rates and inflation into 1997 , which sent financial markets spiralling around the globe . 
the release of better-than-expected U.S. November employment data helped calm the market , however , and both overseas and local financial markets retraced from their weakest levels . 
dealers said the local market had initially gapped on the back of the U.S. market &apos;s weakness and on fears of a selloff on Wall Street at its 1430 GMT opening . 
&quot; We have just been following the trend of the U.S. market today , &quot; a trader said . 
some traders felt , however , that the local bond market had shown resilience on the day . 
one noted that a batch of negative local statistics had failed to faze the bond market at all this week . 
both local and offshore buyers appeared keen to buy the market above the psychological 16 percent mark . 
&quot; But it &apos;s not over yet ... it &apos;s the flip of a coin , &quot; a dealer said , adding that Wall Street &apos;s reaction to Greenspan would dictate direction in the short-term . 
trade on the currency market was relatively subdued as both importers and exporters kept the rand in a tight range . 
at the finish it was quoted at 4.6570 / 6620 against the dollar after settling at 4.6750 / 6800 on Thursday . 
&quot; Nothing much has happened today ... all the action has been on the bond and equities , &quot; a dealer said . 
trader said there had been both importer demand at the 4.6550 level and exporters selling above the 4.66 level which kept the currency confined in a narrow range for the day . 
dealers said a test of the 4.68 level , which held well during the week , appeared likely again next week although the Reserve Bank was expected to offer support to the currency if that level was breached . 
against the crosses , the rand was quoted at 7.6591 / 6697 against sterling from 7.5807 / 5935 previously and at 0.3296 / 3300 marks from 0.3323 / 3328 on Thursday . 
on the money market , three-month NCD rates were pegged at between 17.15 and 17.20 percent offered , up from 17.10 to 17.15 percent on Thursday , while the 90-day BA rate was also quoted in a higher 16.50 to 16.75 percent range from 16.40 to 16.65 percent on Thursday . 
the Reserve Bank indicated the money market shortage at 9.269 billion rand on Thursday from 9.739 billion rand on Wednesday . 
bond Exchange statistics showed foreigners were net buyers of local bonds worth 47.88 million rand on Thursday after selling 32.79 million on Wednesday . 
nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 37.16 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement date -- from 3.62 billion rand previously .
