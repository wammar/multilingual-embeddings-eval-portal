activity in U.S. foreign crude markets for delivery into the U.S. Gulf slowed to a nearly complete halt Friday afternoon ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s pre-Memorial Day sleepiness , &quot; said one trader . 
the North Sea market provided the only real fireworks , with Glencore &apos;s buying of a Brent cargo for June 9-11 loading at a rather pricey 17 cents premium to July Brent seen as possibly signaling some sort of posturing by Glencore . 
&quot; They &apos;re playing a game of some kind of game to try to firm up prices , &quot; said another trader . 
Glencore is said to be just one cargo short of putting together an ultra large crude carrier ( ULCC ) for shipment to South Africa , traders said . 
domestically , Brent being offered into the USG was talked at a 60 cents discount to July WTI / Cushing , but only notionally , since talk was so thin . 
some traders said buyers would not likely show too much interest until the deltas soften to somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 cents below July WTI / Cushing since the domestic market is currently viewed as well supplied . 
on the West African scene , a Forcados cargo for June 20-25 loading was heard done at a 22 cents premium to dated Brent , with a European trading house doing the selling and the buyer as yet unidentified . 
on the Latin American side , players said the outcome of Colombia state-owned Ecopetrol &apos;s latest tender for its coveted light sweet Cusiana would have to wait until next week . 
traders said Ecopetrol pushed the loading date back to June 22-23 after a first round of bidding for the previous June 17-18 loading window turned in bids far below the Colombian company &apos;s liking . 
the delay may give the pricey shipping market a chance to cool down , traders said . 
in other Latin talk , a cargo of Colombian Cano Limon crude was heard offered at a $ 2.15 a barrel discount to July WTI / Cushing fob , but other traders thought that number awfully high . 
talk was too thin to split those differences reliably . 
also , a European oil company was still reported trying to turn around a cargo of Colombian Vasconia at a $ 3.45 discount to July WTI / Cushing after picking it up last week at $ 3.60 under fob .
