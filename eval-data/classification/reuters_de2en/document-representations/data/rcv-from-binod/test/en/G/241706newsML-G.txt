U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Saturday told Latin Americans to stop looking to their governments to clean up rivers , lands and skies , saying organised citizens and the private sector should help preserve the environment . 
&quot; Governments alone cannot provide all the solutions , &quot; Gore told a one-day regional summit on sustainable economic development in this eastern Bolivian city . 
&quot; The private sector , non-governmental organisations and international financial institutions have increasingly important roles to play . 
sustainable development , a principle approved by world leaders at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , means pursuing economic growth without harming the environment . 
Gore &apos;s plane was diverted to Cochabamba , 150 miles ( 250 km ) west of Santa Cruz due to heavy rains in this tropical city . 
the vice president arrived four hours behind schedule in Santa Cruz , causing the summit to open 90 minutes late . 
in his speech , Gore , who has had a longstanding interest in environmental issues , called for urgent , concerted action so that all Latin Americans , 40 percent of whom live under the poverty line , have access to clean water and electricity . 
more than one third of Latin Americans lack electricity and many to clean drinking water . 
&quot; We are here today for one reason and one reason alone : to do all we humanly can to improve the wellbeing of our children and grand children , &quot; Gore said . 
&quot; To ensure that they live in a world of peace , a world with fresh air and clean water . 
the meeting &apos;s host , Bolivia &apos;s President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , proposed that North , Central and South American nations draft agreements on sustainable development for 2005 , when they hope to set up a Pan-American free trade zone . 
&quot; The real possibility to achieve sustainable development is ... here , provided we are ready to work without trepidation on an all-encompassing treaty , &quot; the Bolivian leader said . 
but despite all the calls to work together and the optimistic tone of the speeches , both organisational problems and differences over the agenda hunted the conference , leading several leaders to cancel their visit and others to cut it short , often using only bland excuses . 
only 14 heads of state showed up for the conference , forcing organisers to shorten the meeting to one day from the original two . 
Bolivia had announced last Monday that 24 leaders were expected to attend . 
officials have said off-the-record that the main problem was a lack on consensus on the scope of the meeting , with Washington insisting on focusing on the environment and several Latin American nations arguing that poverty and economic development should take precedence . 
&quot; Many ( heads of state ) did not show up because they did not know what they would be discussing , &quot; an official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . 
the result was a long , &quot; painfully negotiated &quot; meeting agenda that lacked a clear focus , said one official who took part in the eight-month-long discussions to set it up . 
indeed , the final declaration &apos;s draft was a bulky , 50-page compilation of a wide range of environmental , economic and social problems affecting the region and calling for concrete steps to solve them . 
in a separate , four-day meeting last week in La Paz , 300 miles ( 500 km ) west of Santa Cruz , first ladies from the Americas , including U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , demanded a bigger slice of power for women in the region . 
&quot; We urge governments to implement public policies aimed at promoting equal access of women to decision-making processes , &quot; they said in a declaration . 
Mrs. Clinton told her peers they should foster education , especially for girls , if the region &apos;s fledgling democracies and market economies were to develop .
