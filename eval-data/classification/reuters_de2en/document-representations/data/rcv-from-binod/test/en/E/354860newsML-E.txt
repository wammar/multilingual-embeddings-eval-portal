while most expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady in the near term , a recent speech by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan does contain hints that a preemptive tightening could occur as early as this week , economists say . 
in his January 21 Senate testimony , Greenspan took the unusual step of quoting verbatim from his own Humphrey-Hawkins testimony of February 1996 -- outlining that the potential for wage-related inflation remains the chief Fed policy concern . 
&quot; suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far . 
at some point in the future , the trade-off of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end , &quot; Greenspan noted . 
describing the relationship between job insecurity and low wage pressures as &quot; a transitional rather than a lasting phenomenon , &quot; Greenspan cautioned &quot; the recent pickup in some measures of wages suggests that the transition may already be running its course . 
the Fed chairman also pointed out monetary policy acts with a lag -- a reminder of the need for preemptive moves . 
Ken Bercuson , head of research at SBC Warburg , commented &quot; ( Greenspan ) said the transition may have ran its course . 
he thinks ( low wage inflation is ) over . 
referring to Greenspan &apos;s recent testimony , Bercuson noted &quot; the key phrase is about the recent wage indicators , &quot; and &quot; he believes price inflation depends on wage inflation . 
SBC Warburg expected the FOMC to raise the 5.25-percent fed funds rate by 25 basis points after its two-day policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
Bercuson said the Fed was willing to take a gamble last year , hoping that the economy would slow down -- a gamble that strong 1996 data have shown the Fed has lost . 
Goldman , Sachs and Co senior economist Ed McKelvey , commenting on Labor costs , warned &quot; the horse is out of the barn &quot; and said a February tightening cannot be ruled out . 
referring to Greenspan &apos;s concern about the transitional nature of subdued wage performance , McKelvey pointed out the wages-and-salaries component of the Employment Cost Index stood below 3.0 percent between 1992 and early 1996 . 
however , that ECI component rose in 1996 to end the year up 3.3 percent while the jobless rate fell below 5.5 percent . 
McKelvey noted &quot; the timing and gradual pace of this pickup imply that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unempoyment ( NAIRU ) is between 5.5 percent and 6.0 percent . 
Joseph Carson , managing director at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , commenting on the January 1996 easing &quot; insurance , &quot; remarked &quot; at mid-year 1996 , many of the members wanted to reverse that decision , but Mr. Greenspan kept policy unchanged because he thought there were several reasons why growth would slow . 
obviously , he was wrong . 
Carson who expects a 25-point funds rate hike on Wednesday added that &quot; another reason why the Fed needs to tighten is because the financial markets are no longer doing the Fed &apos;s job . 
&quot; It is now incumbent on the Fed to practice what it has preached over the last few years , be forward-looking and raise rates before the need for action is evident to the financial markets , &quot; Carson said . 
Greenspan also made clear of late that , while the Consumer Price Index likely overstates inflation , this has no implications for monetary policy . 
&quot; Such a ( CPI ) revision implies faster growth in potential output , as well as actual output . 
accordingly , it does not alter the relationship between resource utilization and inflation , &quot; the Fed chairman told the Senate in January . 
MFR Inc advisor Stephen Axilrod , a former Fed Staff Director and FOMC Secretary , said the Fed may &quot; vote an asymmetric ( policy ) directive and do something before Mr. Greenspan testifies . 
Greenspan is due to testify before Congress later this month . 
the chairman has often used such opportunity in the past to give the nation an in-depth insight into the rationale for Fed policy . 
&quot; They were close to a tightening last summer , and then , the statistics got weak . 
now , they are unexpectedly strong relative to the forecast , and they are backing into thinking about a tightening again , &quot; Axilrod added .
