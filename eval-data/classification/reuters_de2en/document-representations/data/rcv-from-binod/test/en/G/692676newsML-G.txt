the United Nations Earth Summit agreed on Friday to put off until 2000 a decision on whether to negotiate a treaty on managing the world &apos;s shrinking forests . 
the plan was a compromise between the European Union and Canada which pushed for immediate talks towards a treaty , and the United States and a number of other countries which said efforts would be better spent enforcing existing laws . 
environmentalists backed the United States , saying negotiating a treaty would only waste time and likely would result in weaker policies to curb timber companies . 
under the deal , the U.N. Council on Sustainable Development would decide in 2000 whether to seek a treaty , after a panel on forest policies reports to it in 1999 . 
the panel established under the deal will also focus on pushing implementation of existing controls on logging . 
in addition , the panel will study effects of trade in forest products and services , and transferring technology and funds to poorer countries so they can better manage forest resources .
