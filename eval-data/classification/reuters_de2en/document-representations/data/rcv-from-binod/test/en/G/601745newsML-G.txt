a Canadian man who acted as a courier pleaded guilty to money laundering in a Canada-based lottery scam that may have netted more than $ 100,000 by conning elderly people in the United States . 
Pietro Paolo Codispoti , of St. Hubert , a suburb of Montreal , on Tuesday pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering , fined $ 7,500 and sentenced to three concurrent one-year prison terms for his part in the scam . 
Prosecutor Cheryl Richards said Codispoti , 32 , was the courier for a scheme in which people living in the United States were told they had won the Canadian lottery but had to pay a 7 percent tax up front in order to collect their &quot; winnings . 
they were directed to mail their checks to an address in the Cayman Islands . 
Codispoti &apos;s job was to collect the checks from the post office box on Grand Cayman Island and forward them to an address in the British Caribbean territory of Turks &amp; Caicos , Richards said . 
he collected more than $ 35,000 on his latest trip to the Caymans and the scam might have taken in over $ 100,000 since it began , Richards said . 
Codispoti said he was approached in a Montreal bar to become a courier but could not remember the names of the people who hired him . 
he said he was paid $ 4,800 for the trip to the Cayman Islands . 
Richards said authorities in Canada and the United States were notified and investigations were under way .
