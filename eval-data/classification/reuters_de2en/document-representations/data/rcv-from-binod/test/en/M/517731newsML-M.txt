U.S. debt futures are expected to extend Thursday &apos;s gains in the next several sessions , particularly if June T-bonds close above the 20-day moving average of 107-22 / 32 , technical analysts said . 
Terence Gabriel , a technical analyst at IDEA Inc , said a close above 107-22 / 32 would be the first time June bonds closed above their 20-day moving average since February 26 . 
he said the negative momentum of the contract &apos;s moving average , which has been forming a negative slope on the charts , has been slowing . 
he said the moving average has been rising after hitting its lowest level in mid-March . 
&quot; The rate of decline has been slowing down , &quot; he said . 
on Thursday , June T-bonds steadily inched up to 108-07 / 32 , near resistance at 108-08 / 32 , on short-covering pressure . 
Short-covering was sparked Thursday morning by U.S. weekly jobless claims , which rose to 332,000 from the prior week &apos;s upward revised 324,000 , and compared with average trade forecasts for 317,000 . 
however , some analysts said the stage for the market &apos;s rally was set on Wednesday when June bonds managed to creep up towards 107-17 / 32 despite stronger than expected monthly gains in industrial production . 
but on Thursday , June T-bonds finally cracked the 2-1 / 2 week high of 107-28 / 32 , which also represents the weekly Gann resistance level , Gabriel said . 
both bond and Eurodollar futures showed constructive internal factors in the last several days , such as positive daily stochastics . 
weekly stochastics for September Eurodollars were particularly oversold . 
like June bonds , September Eurodollars rallied out of their 2-1 / 2 week range . 
September rose to 93.775 , above the March 27 high of 93.77 which had confined the contract for the last 2-1 / 2 weeks . 
Gabriel also noted that September held above 93.63 , a trendline measurement from July 1996 , when the market sold off sharply last week . 
the contract set a daily low of 93.64 on last Friday , Monday and Tuesday . 
resistance for the contract is at 93.89 and 93.92 , the 200-day moving average . 
several analysts are looking for June T-bonds to rise to 108-24 / 32 to 109-00 in the near term , but said the contract would have to rise above 109-16 / 32 to turn the medium-term trend positive .
