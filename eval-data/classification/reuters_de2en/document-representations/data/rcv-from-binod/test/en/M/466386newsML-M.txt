continued profit taking drove CME hog and pork belly futures to sharply lower closes , traders said . 
hogs closed 1.300 to 0.175 lower with April off 1.100 at 73.175 cents . 
pork bellies ended 2.900 to 0.850 lower with May off most at 75.950 cents . 
commercial and commission house profit taking kept futures pressured with sell stops adding to the early setback . 
the market appeared overbought after three days of limit gains following the banning of pork exports from Taiwan due to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a little bit of correction against the trend - bearish guys used the rally to get short and the guys who caught part of this move are tempted to sell out and take a little profit , &quot; said Dennis Smith , broker with LIT division of First Options . 
expectations the U.S. pork industry would receive the most benefit from the Taiwan situation boosted futures to a very large premium over current cash hog prices . 
topping action in both cash pork products and live markets added to incentive to take profits . 
cash hogs were called steady to $ 0.50 per cwt lower Wednesday , traders said . 
a Taiwan agriculture official said it would be difficult to resume pork exports to Japan within five years . 
also , the disease as of early Tuesday had been detected at 357 breeding centers , up from nine just five days ago . 
Smith added that he did not see anything to alter the bullish situation in regards to Taiwan but many traders were starting to focus on the hogs and Pigs report . 
analysts &apos; estimates for all U.S. hogs as of March 1 averaged 99.2 percent of a year ago in a range of 97 to 100.9 percent . 
hogs kept for breeding averaged 101.4 percent of a year ago and ranged 98.5 to 104 and hogs kept for market averaged 99 percent and ranged 96 to 100.8 percent . 
Rand Financials bought April and sold June after late buying by ABN Chicogo Corp and E.D. &amp; F. 
man in June . 
in hog options , commission house were on both sides of June and July puts and calls and they were trying to do risk reversals in October , pit sources said . 
pork bellies fell on profit taking and cash price concerns . 
Fund selling hit values late before another fund bought , keeping May from sinking the daily limit . 
demand for bellies again abated when cash prices reached $ 75 per cwt , which USDA quoted at midday , sources noted . 
analysts also noted that bacon is not one of the pork items that would see heavy demand from the Taiwan export stoppage . 
also , belly stocks have continued to increase as the board allowed a hedge , they said . 
after the close , the CME reported a net in-movement of 926,000 lbs of pork bellies into CME approved warehouses outside Chicago in its weekly out-of-town report . 
the figure was under trade estimates for in-movement of 1.0 million to 2.0 million lbs and well under net in-movement of 2.486 million lbs last week . 
last year &apos;s net in-movement was 709,000 lbs .
