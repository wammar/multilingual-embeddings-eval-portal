the global economy has shaken off weakness in Western Europe and is expected to achieve healthy growth through next year , the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday . 
the IMF , in its semiannual report card on the economy , gave good grades to the emerging market countries , saying they are reaping the benefits from an often-painful return to fundamentals undertaken in recent years . 
&quot; The global economic expansion is expected to continue at a satisfactory pace in 1996-97 and over the medium term , &quot; the IMF report said . 
in a briefing on the report , IMF chief economist Michael Mussa told reporters , &quot; We expect a moderate strengthening and continued good performance on the inflaiton front . 
the report by the international lending agency estimated the global economy would grow by 3.8 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 1997 after growing 3.5 percent in 1995 . 
industrial countries were expected to grow 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 1997 after growing 2.1 percent last year . 
developing countries also showed vigorous activity , growing 6.3 percent this year from 5.9 percent in 1995 . 
growth will slow slightly next year to 6.2 percent . 
the report said the industrial countries showed uneven results . 
the the United States chalked up robust growth and low unemployment but Germany and France lagged behind . 
however , it said the outlook for Europe was improved as exchange rates came back into line , setting the stage for increased activity . 
&quot; Together with a correction of earlier exchange rate misalignments , this has improved prospects for a resumption of stronger growth in the latter part of 1996 , &quot; the report said . 
it said the entrenched inflation that has stalked policy makers for years is finally on the run , but cautioned officials to guard the exit in case price pressures return with the strengthening economy . 
&quot; Inflation rates in industrial countries , as well as in a number of developing countries have declined to their lowest levels in decades , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Monetary authorities will , of course course , need to remain vigilant &quot; regarding price pressures as growth continues or strengthens . 
as an example , it said the U.S. economy was growing flat out with low unemployment and would benefit from a tightening of monetary policy so inflation doesn &apos;t break loose . 
however , the Federal Reserve &apos;s Open Market Committee decided to leave rates unchanged for now in its meeting Tuesday . 
still the IMF projects short-term rates will rise about one-half of a percentage point next year . 
as it has in the past , the IMF scolded Europe for not taking the tough actions needed to reform its poorly functioning labour markets . 
&quot; For many countries , particularly in Europe , fiscal imbalances are related to shortcomings in the function of labour markets , which has resulted in a dramatic upward trend in unemployment over the past 25 years , &quot; the report said . 
it said that , although the Japanese economy has responded remarkably well to stimulative efforts by the authorities with growth estimated at 3.5 percent this year after edging up only 0.9 percent in 1995 , it is probably too soon to move interest rates higher . 
&quot; But official interest rates will obviously need to be adjusted upward as the recovery gets further under way , &quot; 
as a result , it estimated growth in Japan would moderate to 2.7 percent in 1997 . 
turning to Germany , which is estimated to grow 1.3 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 1997 after being up 1.9 percent in 1995 , the IMF said the country had acted properly in easing monetary policy over the past year to help secure recovery . 
the report also made clear that the so-called transition economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union , which have often been the main focus of IMF policy makers in recent years , may have turned the corner . 
it estimated they would grow by 0.4 percent this year and 4.0 percent in 1997 after five years of decline . 
&quot; The rewards for comprehensive reform and stabilisation efforts are very striking among the transition countries , where the results of economic transformation are increasingly visible , &quot; the report said .
